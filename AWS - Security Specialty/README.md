# Identity and Access Management (IAM)
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions]]

- contains details and credentials of root user account
- access keys should not be configured for root user (additional user with relevant privileges should be created instead)
	- limit access methods to root account

## Groups
- groups are associated with set of permissions allowing members of that group to inherit those permissions
	- groups don't have credentials associated with it
	- object within IAM

## Roles
- associated set of permissions that allows access to AWS resources
	- not associated with users or groups
	- sort of works like discord roles
### Examples of roles:
#### Service Roles
- allows other AWS services to perform actions on one's behalf
- only exist in account in which they were created (can't be used for cross-account access)
- when using EC2 roles for deploying and running EC2 instances, it is best practice to associate EC2 instances with a role (removes the need to store credentials on any instance)
	- role itself
	- instance profile
		- container for role
		- used to pass data to EC2 instance


#### User Roles
- when user assumes a role, their current permissions get temporarily replaced by the role's permissions

#### Web Identity Federate Role
- allows a single sign on (SSO) approach
- federated access means user has been authenticated by external source 
	- can be through well-known identity providers (IDPs) such as Amazon, Google, or Facebook

#### SAML 2.0 federated roles
- allows creation of roles that have been federated through one's internal corporate directory 
- the external authentication system is one's own corporate directory of users
	- e.g. Microsoft Active Directory (MSAD) # Access Policies 
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Access Policies]]

- define who or what can or can't access AWS resources

<u>Policy Structure</u>:
1. Version
	- shows version of policy language
2. Statement
	- acts as group for parameters in json structure
3. Sid
	- statement identification
4. Effect
	- can be either *allow* or *deny*
		- allows or denies access to resource
5. Action
	- list of actions to be allowed or denied access to
		- action is first defined by service and then preceded with action
6. Resource
	- provides Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
		- tells which resource the permissions apply to 
7. Condition
	- optional
	- dictates under what conditions policy is in effect
	
![[Pasted image 20220131192503.png]]
- Policy Types:
	## Identity-based Policies
	- attached to IAM user, group, or role
	- controls what actions an identity (users, groups of users, roles) can perform on which resources and under what conditions
		- e.g. allowing user John to run the EC2 `RunInstances` action 
	- can be AWS-managed, customer-managed or in-line policies
		### AWS-managed
		- policies that are created and managed by AWS
		### Customer-managed
		- custom policy that is made by the customer 
		### In-line 
		- added directly to user, group, or role
		- deleted when the identity is deleted
	## Resource-based Policies
	- very similar to in-line policies except they are attached to resources instead of identities
	- can be attached to buckets and S3 objects
	- lets you specify who has access to resource and what actions they can perform on it
	- policy looks the same as in the example policy, however includes a *Principal* parameter
		- identifies user, role, account, or federated user that permissions should be applied to
	## Permissions boundaries
	- governs maximum permissions an identity-based policy can associate with any user or role
	## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	- can attach to buckets and S3 objects
	- similar to resource-based policies
	- use only to control cross-account access from different AWS account or public access
	## Organization SCPs
	- SCP stands for Service Control Policy
	- used by AWS organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts
	- similar to permissions boundaries within identity objects
		- they also set maximum permission level that can be given to members of an AWS account or organization unit (OU)
		- restrict permissions for resource-based and identity-based policies
		- restricts permissions, doesn't grant permissions

## Policy evaluation
Determination of permissions when accessing resource:
1. Authentication
2. Determine context of request
	- request processed and associated permissions are defined
	- actions, resources, principals, environment data, and resource data are examined
3. Policy evaluation
	- policy types evaluated in order of identity-based, resource-based, IAM permissions boundaries, and SCPs
4. Permission Result
	- access granted or denied

- deny actions overrule allow actions 
# Federated and Mobile Access
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Federated and Mobile Access]]

- used for providing resource to a large amount of users
	- unfeasible to create individual IAM accounts for every user to access the resource
- allows access to AWS resources without IAM user account
- credentials federated by identity provider (IDP)
	- e.g. Microsoft Active Directory Accounts, Google, Facebook, etc.

<u>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)</u>
- allows secure exchange of authentication data between different domains
- users security tokens between an IdP and a SAML consumer

## Social Federation
### Amazon Cognito
- made for enabling secure authentication and access control for new and existing users accessing web or mobile applications
- generate tokens after  authentication that manages access 
- best practice when creating applications that require social IdPs for authentication

Two main Components:

1. User Pools
	- scalable user directories
	- allow users to login to mobile application
	- ![[Pasted image 20220203163059.png]]
2. Identity Pools
	- assigns permissions to user to access AWS resources (uses temporary credentials
	- ![[Pasted image 20220203163348.png]]

# Shared Responsibility Model
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Shared Responsibility Model]]

Three different shared responsibility models:
1. Infrastructure
	- most common model
	- covers infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
	- ![[Pasted image 20220131154703.png]]
	- AWS responsible for security of the cloud, customer is responsible for security in the cloud
2. Container
	- customer does not have access to some of infrastructure-level components such as the operating system
	- examples of services in container model: Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Relational Database Service (RDS), Elastic Beanstalk
	- ![[Pasted image 20220131161816.png]]
	- AWS has more responsibilities with this model than the infrastructure model
		- platform and application management, operating system, and network configuration are responsibility of AWS
3. Abstract
	- ![[Pasted image 20220131162045.png]]
	- AWS responsible for even more security
		- in addition manages server-side encryption and network traffic protection
	- examples of services in abstract model: Simple Queue Service (SQS), DynamoDB, and S3
	- accessed through endpoints
		- no access to operating system (infrastructure) or platform running these services (container)# Configuring Infrastructure Security
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Configuring Infrastructure Security]]
## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- private section of AWS network
- can be public-face 

### Subnets
- can only reside in a single availability zone (e.g. only in eu-west-1bAZ)
- each subnet should be configured for a specific use (i.e. segmentation); this is security best practice
	- e.g. subnet can contain only application servers, other subnet can contain only database servers, etc.
- falls within CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) block of VPC
	- e.g. if VPC CIDR block is $10.0.0.0/16$, subnets can be the following:
		- $10.0.1.0/24$
			- $10.0.1.0$ - Network address
			- $10.0.1.1$ - AWS routing
			- $10.0.1.2$ - AWS DNS
			- $10.0.1.3$ - AWS future use
			- $10.0.1.255$ - Broadcast address
		- $10.0.2.0/24$
		- $10.0.3.0/24$
		- etc.
	- note the first address is reserved for the network address, and the last address is reserved for the broadcast address
	- AWS reserves the first three host addresses in any subnet
		- first host address reserved for internal AWS VPC routing
		- second host address for AWS DNS
		- third host address for future use
	- therefore, 251 (out of 256) available host addresses for customer use in /16 subnet
	
	<u>Route Table</u>: table subnet uses for routing traffic
	- if no route table is defined, default VPC route table is used

### Flow Logs Tab
- captures IP traffic sent between network interfaces of subnet
- captured within CloudWatch

## Internet Gateway (IGW)
- helps create a public subnet
- allows traffic to traverse from subnet in VPC to internet and vice versa

## Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- virtual network level firewalls
- stateless
- default NACL created when VPC is created
	- all traffic allowed by default (therefore default NACL is insecure)
- two fundamental components
	1. Inbound Rules
	2. Outbound Rules
- final rule of NACL is that any traffic that isn't categorized by any of the rules gets dropped
- rules read in ascending order until match is found

## Security Groups
- similar to NACLs (provide virtual firewall) except operates at instance level rather than network level
- associated with instances rather than subnets
- controls traffic to and from instances within VPC
- stateful
- no field for *Allow* or *Deny* traffic, as all rules in security group are assumed to be allowed (traffic not categorized as such is dropped)
	- works as a whitelist for traffic
- all rules evaluated before decision is made

## Bastion Hosts
- used to gain access to instances that reside within private subnets
- bastion host resides within public subnet
- hardened EC2 instance with restrictive controls
- acts as ingress gateway

<u>Public Subnet</u>: a subnet associated with a route table pointing to an internet gateway (IGW) with a destination address of 0.0.0.0/0

- no packet is directly exchanged between internet and IPs inside private subnet (it goes first through the bastion host)

## NAT Instances and NAT Gateways
- kind of like the opposite of bastion host
- allows instances in private subnets to initiate a connection out to the internet via NAT resource
- blocks all inbound public-initiated traffic
- allows private instances access to internet
	- usually used for maintenance-related tasks such as updates

### NAT Gateway
- AWS managed resource
- offers enhanced bandwidth and availability in comparison to NAT instance
- requires far less administrative configuration than NAT instance# DDoS Protection
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#DDoS Protection]]
- protections include AWS Shield Advanced ($3000 a month) and AWS Shield Standard (free)
## DDoS Patterns
### SYN Floods
- abuses three-way handshake when connection is being established between client and server
![[Pasted image 20220213185859.png]]
- the final ACK completes the handshake, but this is dropped in SYN Flood attack to leave connection open

### HTTP Floods
- many GET or POST requests sent to server

### Ping of Death (POD)
- oversized ping packets sent to target
- maximum size of packet is 65,535 bytes, but with fragmentation you can send a lot of data to target

## AWS Shield
- specify ARN of resources and services Shield should protect
- Elastic IP Address (EIP) should be specified first for EC2 instance in order to use Shield on it
### AWS Shield Standard
- free
- helps protect against common DDoS attacks operating at network and transport layers

### AWS Shield Advanced
- $3000 per month
- application traffic monitoring
- monitors network, transport, and application layers
- comes with AWS DDoS Response Team (known as DRT)

### Rate-Based Rules
- counts number of requests received from IP address over 5 minutes
- can define max number of request from singe IP within 5 minutes (must be over 2000)

### AWS CloudFront and Amazon Route 53
- edge services 
- recommended to use these in conjunction with Shield to further decrease chances of compromise
- helps detect DDoS attacks
- allows for layer 3, 4, and 7 attack mitigation (also 6 in the case of CloudFront used in conjunction with AWS WAF) # Implementing Application Security
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Implementing Application Security]]

## AWS WAF
Three primary elements:
1. Web ACL (Access Control List)
	- contains rules and rule groups (defines what should be inspected within requests)
2. Rules
	- defines specific criteria for what web ACL should be inspecting and what action to take (allow/block/count)
3. Rule Groups
	- allows you to group a set of rules

### AWS Firewall Manager
- manages WAF rules across multi-account environment when using AWS Organizations
- uses WAF rules that are grouped together within a rule group

## Managing Security Configuration of ELBs
- ELB stands for Elastic Load Balancing
	- controls, manages, and distributes incoming requests to a specified resource group 
- can be internal or internet-facing
	- internal ELBs only have private internal IP addresses and can only serve requests originating from within VPC
	- internet-facing ELBs have public DNS names and have public and internal IP addresses
### Types of ELBs
Three different ELBs:
<u>Application Load Balancer</u>
- supports incoming traffic for web applications running HTTP or HTTPS
- allows routing of requests such as to different ports

<u>Network Load Balancer</u>
- supports millions of incoming requests per second
- ideal if low latency and high performance are priorities

<u>Classic Load Balancer</u>
Using a Classic Load Balancer instead of an Application Load Balancer has the following benefits:
-   Support for EC2-Classic
-   Support for TCP and SSL listeners
-   Support for sticky sessions using application-generated cookies

## Securing APIs
- AWS API gateway
### Controlling Access to APIs
Methods for controlling authentication and authorization:
#### IAM Roles and Policies
- using IAM, policies can be associated with user, role, or group to dictate permissions
#### IAM Tags
- can be used in conjunction with IAM policies
- used for references pertaining to security controls such as in the following example: a user being able to perform a specific action based on the resource tag 
#### Resource Policies
- attached to resources (unlike IAM which is attached to identity)
- specifies principal that has been granted or denied access to invoke associate API
#### VPC Endpoint Policies
- also a resource-based policy, but is a VPC endpoint
	- VPC endpoints allows access to AWS services using private IP addresses
- controls access to private APIs
- can be used in conjunction with API Gateway resource policies for additional security
#### Lambda Authorizers
- uses AWS Lambda functions to restrict who can invoke REST API methods
- can use bearer-based tokens or HTML headers, paths, query string parameters, and stage variables
#### Amazon Cognito User Pools
- APIs can be configured to have `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer  to authenticate users via Amazon Cognito user pool API gateway
	- token is validated before allowing access# Incident Response
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Incident Response]]

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
Addresses four primary control areas:
1. Directive Controls
	- establishes governance, risk, and compliance models
2. Preventative Controls
	- protects workloads and mitigates threats and vulnerabilities
3. Detective Controls
	- provides full visibility and transparency over operation of deployments
4. Responsive Controls
	- drives the remediation of potential deviation from security baselines

## Threat Detection and Management
### AWS GuardDuty
- regional-based managed service
- powered machine learning
- monitors logs and detects unexpected / unusual behavior

### AWS Security Hub
- brings security statistical data into single place
	- presented in series of tables and graphs
- insights - grouping of findings that meet specific criteria base from specific filters and statements
	- e.g. users with most suspicious activity, S3 buckets with public write or read permissions, EC2 instances with missing security patches, etc.

## Forensics
- recommended to have an account with preconfigured settings dedicated to forensics
	- compromised instances can be moved to forensics account
	- note that the instance cannot be moved to different AWS account
- can also create forensic instance for forensic analysis
	- could take snapshot of compromised instance / EBS volume and attach it to forensic instance

## Common Infrastructure Security Incident
Common approach in a breach scenario (blue side):
1. Capture - obtain metadata from instance
2. Protect - prevent EC2 instance from being terminated (enable termination protection)
3. Isolate - isolate instance by modifying security group or updated NACL to deny all traffic destined for IP address of instance
4. Detach - remove affected instance from any autoscaling groups
5. Deregister - remove EC2 instance from any associated ELBs
6. Snapshot - take snapshot of EBS volumes for forensics
7. Tag - highlight instance that is prepared for forensic investigation
# Secure Connections to AWS Environment
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Secure Connections to AWS Environment]]
- can connect securely using either VPN connection or Direct Connect connection

## AWS VPN
Uses two components:
1. Virtual Private Gateway (VPN gateway)
	- resides within AWS
	- consists of two endpoints located in different data centers
2. Customer gateway

![[Pasted image 20220215120110.png]]
- consists of two IPsec tunnel
	- <u>IPsec Tunnel</u>: secure network protocol allowing encrypted communication between two endpoints 
	- implemented at IP layer
- uses public network to establish connection
### Routing
Route table example:

Destination|Target
----|--------
10.0.0.0/16|Local
172.16.0.0/16|pcx-1234abcd
172.16.1.0/24|vgw-wxyz6789

1. First route is local route of VPC (found in every route table)
2. Second route points to target relating to VPC peering connection
3. Third route point to VPN gateway

- if packet is meant for destination that is covered by two subnets, it will go to the more specific subnet
	- e.g. if packet is meant for 172.16.1.5, it will go to the third route even though route 1 and route 2 both cover that destination
- route propagation can be enabled in VPN gateway to automatically add site-to-site VPN connections to route table

## AWS Direct Connect
- like VPN connection; joins your own infrastructure with AWS architecture as if it were a single network
- generally provides more consistent and reliable connection
- Connection runs across private network via an AWS Direct Connect location
![[Pasted image 20220216094601.png]]
Three distinct locations involved to establish link:
1. Corporate site where your own private network resides
2. AWS Direct Connect location (typically owned by AWS partner)
3. AWS VPC within specific AWS region

Prerequisites for configuring and establish connection:
1. Your organization works with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of AWS Partner Network (APN)
2. Your network has co-location connection to AWS Direct Connect location
3. Your organization works with an IPS allowing connection to AWS Direct Connect

Once physical network connection to AWS Direct Connect location established, network must follow this criteria:
1. Authentication - router must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and MD5
2. Network must use single-mode fiber
3. Manually configured speed and full-duplex enabled
4. 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation support enabled

### Virtual Interfaces
- connection can be partitioned into virtual interfaces 
- allows access to other AWS services other than what is within your VPC
# Securing EC2 Instances
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Securing EC2 Instances]]
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the most common of the compute services
- can use Amazon Inspector (vulnerability scanner)

## Key Pairs
- used to allow connection to instance
- uses public key cryptography (2048 bit SSH-2 RSA)
- public key maintained by EC2 instance, private key is with customer
	- keys are unrecoverable if lost
	- public key encrypts creds, private key decrypts

## Monitoring and Logging
### AWS CloudTrail
- tracks and records API calls
- for every API call the following is tracked:
	- API that was called
	- service to which API call was made against
	- timestamp when it was called
	- source IP address of requester

### AWS Config
- logs any change to resources
- acts as resource inventory
- stores and reviews configuration history of resources
- integrates with CloudTrail
	- shows which API call made specific changes
- checks compliance rules

### Amazon CloudWatch
- most common AWS monitoring service
- monitors resource performance over time
- can be used with unified Cloud Agent to collect logs of applications

### VPC Flow Logs
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- captures all IP traffic 

## Isolation
- security group should be created so that a compromised instance can quickly be changed to this group
	- the group should not be able to communicate with any other resources 
- log data should be stored in dedicated S3 bucket
- create IAM roles that only allow read-only access to resources
	- prevents accidentally changing data on instance

## Systems Manager (SSM)
- allows to quickly administer and perform operational actions against instances without SSH or RDP
### Actions
#### Automation
- automate processes against groups of resources via SSM documents
- e.g. patching EC2 instances or creating AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

#### Run Command
- manage fleet of EC2 instances remotely and securely
- can perform maintenance and management without logging into instances
- uses SSM documents to help perform administrative tasks and configuration changes

#### Distributor
- distributes software across instances

#### State Manager
- maintains state of EC2 instances
- uses of state manager:
	- configuring network settings
	- bootstrapping instances
	- ensuring installation of agents are schedually updated
	- running scripts on instances

#### Patch Manager
- automates management of patch updates across EC2 instances
- you can create patch groups which associates a number of instances with a group
	- allows you to associate a group with a single patch baseline
	- instances not associated with patch group will receive default patch baseline# Auditing and Governance
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Auditing and Governance]]
## AWS Artifact
- on-demand portal allowing viewing and downloading AWS security and compliance reports and online agreements
	- these reports are undetaken by external auditors of AWS
	- agreements for accounts made with AWS 

## Securing with CloudTrail
- data (logs) can be encrypted with SSE-KMS
- SHA-256 used for file validation
- when validation is enabled, digest files are created
	- digest files reference every log file delivered within specific timeframe along with associated hash
	- digest files are signed using private key of a public/private key pair used by CloudTrail for that region

Validating if log was tampered with or moved:
`aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn <trailARN> --start-time <start-time>`

## AWS Config
- useful for seeing history of modifications to a resource via looking at the history of configuration items

Components of AWS Config:
- Configuration items
- Configuration streams
- Configuration history
- Configuration snapshots
- Configuration recorder
- Config rules
- Resource relationships
- Config role

### Configuration Items (CI)
- fundamental element of AWS Config
- contains point-in-time snapshot info on configuration data of attributes of an AWS resource such as:
	- current configuration
	- direct relationships resource has with other resources
	- metadata
	- events
- CI updated each time change is made on resource (e.g. create, update, or delete API call made against resource)

Components of Configuration Item:
**Metadata**: info and data about config item
**Attributes**: data of actual resource that CI relates to
**Relationship**: data related to any connected resource (e.g. if CI is related to a subnet, the relationship could contain data related to associated VPC that subnet is part of)
**Current Configuration**:  shows same info that would be generated upon performing a *describe* or *list* API call

## Amazon Macie
- managed service backed by machine learning
- automatically detects, protects, and classifies data within S3 buckets
- classifies data to determine its level of sensitivity# Implementing Logging Mechanisms
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Implementing Logging Mechanisms]]

## Amazon S3 Logging
- most common AWS storage service
- logs can be sent to S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs


Two types of logging within S3:
1. Server access logs
2. Object-level logs

### Server Access Logs
Log details captured:
- identity of requester accessing bucket
- name of bucket being accessed
- timestamp of when action was carried against bucket
- action that was done
- HTML response status
- any error codes
<br>
- source and target buckets must be in same region

### Object-Level Logging
- must be associated with CloudTrail which will record write and read API activity

### Flow Logs
- captures IP traffic across network interfaces
- default log file format:
```bash
${version} ${account-id} ${interface-id} ${srcaddr} ${dstaddr} ${srcport} ${dstport} ${protocol} ${packets} ${bytes} ${start} ${end} ${action} ${log-status}
```
1. version: version of the flow log
2. account-id: AWS account ID
3. interface-id: interface ID that log stream data applies to
4. srcaddr: IP source address
5. dstaddr: IP destination address
6. srcport: source port used for traffic
7. dstport: destination port for traffic
8. protocol: protocol number being used for traffic
9. packets: total number of packets sent during capture 
10. bytes: total number of bytes sent during capture
11. start: timestamp of when capture window started
12. end: timestamp of when capture windows finished
13. action: whether traffic was accepted or rejected by security groups
14. log-status: status of logging, which is one of three codes:
	- OK: data is being received
	- NoData: no traffic to capture during capture window
	- SkipData: some data within log was captured due to an error 

## VPC Traffic Mirroring
- duplicates network traffic from elastic network interfaces attached to instances
	- duplicated traffic sent to third-party tools and services for analysis

## CloudTrail
**Trails**: contain configurable options for what to monitor and track
**Events**: every API call is stored as an event
**Log Files**: created every 5 minutes; stored within S3 bucket
**CloudWatch Logs**: logs can be sent to CloudWatch for analysis and monitoring
**API Activity Filters**: provide search and filter functionality when looking at API activity

### Understanding CloudTrail Logs

```
- shows Cloudtrail made *PutObject* request to Amazon S3 to store its log file (see the *key* parameter)

*eventName*: name of API called
*eventSource*: AWS service in which API call was made
*eventTime*: time of API call
*SourceIPAddress*: IP that made the API call (if a service did the API call then instead the name of the service would be displayed)
*userAgent*: agent method of request
*Console.amazonaws.com*: determines that root user made request
*userIdentity*: additional info relating to user agent

### Amazon Athena
- serverless service
- analyzes data stored within Amazon S3 (such as CloudTrail logs)
- uses SQL 

### CloudWatch
- main AWS monitoring service
- collects data and metrics from all supported AWS services 
- can be implemented in a large scale using AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

# Automation
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Automation]]

## Automating Security Detection and Remediation
### Using CloudWatch Events with AWS Lambda and SNS
- can identify event to capture and create an automatic response
#### AWS Lambda 
- serverless compute service

## Amazon EBS Encryption
- EBS volumes provide block-level storage to EC2 instance
	- gives more flexibility for storage capabilities
- default regional encryption setting can be applied to EBS volumes to automatically encrypt new EBS volumes 
- uses KMS service to encrypt data

## Amazon EBS
- used for file-level storage
- support in-transit and at-rest encryption

2. KMS genrate two data keys using the CMK: plaintext data key and cipher blob of that key
3. KMS sends the keys back to requesting client
4. Client encrypts object data with plaintext version of data key and stores the resulting encrypted object.
5. Client uploads encrypted object data and cipher blob version of key to S3. 
6. Cipher blob key stored as metadata against encrypted object.

#### Decryption

- encryption in transit uses HTTPS
# Managing Key Infrastructure
[[AWS Contents]]
[[AWS Questions#Managing Key Infrastructure]]

## AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
- managed service
- allows you to create, store, rotate, and delete encryption keys
- unlike SSL, KMS not designed for encryption-in-transit
- supports symmetric and asymmetric CMKs

### Customer Master Keys (CMK)
- building block of KMS
- contains material used for encrypting and decrypting data

Three different types of CMKs:
1. AWS-owned
	- rotation period varied from service to service
	- managed and created by AWS
	- e.g. Amazon S3 encryption using S3 master key (SSE-S3)
	- can't view keys
2. AWS-managed
	- can't control rotation frequency
	- can view keys being used and track their usage and key policies
3. Customer-managed
	- full control of keys

### Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
- created by CMKs
- unlike CMKs, doesn't reside within KMS service
- used outside of KMS to encrypt data
- when DEK is generated, the associated CMK will create two DEKs
	1. Plaintext Key
	2. Identical (Encrypted) Key
- <u>Envelope Encryption</u>: using one key to encrypt another key

Amazon S3 server-side encryption and decryption with KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS):
#### SSE-KMS Encryption
![[Pasted image 20220224222854.png]]
1. SSE-KMS encryption mechanism chosen by client and either AWS-managed or customer-managed CMK is selected
2. S3 tells KMS to generate DEKs 
3. Plaintext data key and identical (encrypted) data key generated
4. These data keys are sent to S3. 
5. S3 encrypts object data with plaintext version of data key. Encrypted data is then stored with encrypted version of key. Plaintext data key is destroyed.  

#### SSE-KMS Decryption
![[Pasted image 20220224223534.png]]
1. Request received by S3 to access encrypted object 
2. S3 sends encrypted data key associated with object to KMS
3. KMS uses original CMK to decrypt the data key to generate a plaintext version of that key
4. KMS sends plaintext data key to S3
5. Encrypted object decrypted with that key
6. Plaintext object sent back to client

### Key Material
<u>Key Material</u>: Data used to encrypt and decrypt data
- stored within CMK
- CMK key material can be used to encrypt data key and decrypt it (see [[Managing Key Infrastructure#SSE-KMS Decryption|SSE-KMS Decryption]])
- key material for AWS-managed CMKs gets automatically created
- customer-managed CMKs give option of adding key material or not
	- can even import your own key material known as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
	- BYOK doesn't support automatic key rotation

### Key Policies
- cannot control access to CMKs without key policies
- access to CMK can be configured via:
	1. Key Policies: All access governed by key policy
	2. Key Policies and IAM: Access governed by key policy and IAM identity-based policies
		- allows access via groups and other IAM features
	3. Key Policies and Grants: Access governed by key policy with ability to delete access to other for using the CMK
		- check page 508-512, great explanation
	
## AWS CloudHSM
- fully managed service used for data encryption
- can integrate with KMS in the form of using CloudHSM as a custom key store
	- allows storage of CMKs outside of KMS and into CloudHSM cluster
- HSM stands for Hardware Security Module
	- generates keys and stores them
	- can use different encryption algorithms for both symmetric keys and asymmetric keys
	- manages symmetric and asymmetric keys
	- signs and verifies signatures
	- can use hash function to compute hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs)

### Cloud HSM Users
User types of CloudHSM
1. Precrypto Office
2. Crypto Office
3. Crypto User
4. Appliance User

Operations | PRECO | CO | CU| AU|

#### Precrypto Office (PRECO)
- automatically created upon creating first HSM within cluster
- PRECO user has default creds
- when first connecting to the HSM, you are prompted to change password of PRECO user
	- this turns the PRECO user into a Crypto Office (CO) user

#### Crypto Office (CO)
- greater permissions than PRECO

Permissions:
- create, delete and change passwords of users
- delete keys, certificates, and data on HSM
- obtain HSM metadata

#### Crypto User (CU)
Permissions:

[[AWS Questions]]
## Notes
- AWS Artifact is a resource about compliance-related stuff
- AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources
- Amazon CloudFront is a web service that is used for distributing content 
	- delivers web content through network via edge locations (locations that are closest to the client requesting website), therefore gives client lowest latency
- CloudTrail logs can provide detailed API tracking for Amazon S3 bucket-level and object-level operations
- VPC Flow logging logs IP data going to and from designated network interfaces and stores this data in Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service to query data and analyze big data in Amazon S3
- VPC peering - networking connection between two VPCs that enables traffic to be routed between them 
	- allows instances within those VPCs to communicate with each other as if they were in the same network
- Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for data archiving and long-term backup
- AWS Control Tower enforces and manages governance rules for security, operations, and compliance at scale
- ACLs were the first authorization mechanism in S3. Bucket policies are the newer method, and the method used for almost all AWS services. Policies can implement very complex rules and permissions, ACLs are simplistic (they have ALLOW but no DENY).
	- A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend that you disable ACLs except in unusual circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually
